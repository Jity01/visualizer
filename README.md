# cartovis

this is a [webapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#/media/File:Cat_August_2010-4.jpg) project that makes visualizations based on some given academic concept.
only handles 18.06 (linear alg) topics as of yet.

## more details on the process

if you typed in, "what does _____ look like?"
- you get an image of that concept, equipped with a description of how the image is representing it.

## example

if you paste in, what does “cause and effect” look like?
- you could get a box (cause) pointing to another box (effect).
- description could be something like: the existence of the former box led to the latter box happening.
